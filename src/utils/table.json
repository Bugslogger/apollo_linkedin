Model monitoring were in R&D at the time I left.\n\nOn the NLP side, I have extensively worked with and in the majority of cases trained models for: Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment, ESG-relation Classification, Question Answering, Coreference Resolution, POS tagging, Open Information Extraction, Entity Linking, Summarisation and Sentence-level embeddings. I am particularly proud of the novel contextual Entity Linker that was created as part of this project.\n\nAs part of my role I mentored junior team members helping them grow their Machine Learning Engineering and NLP skills, alongside elements of project management and presenting. I very much enjoyed empowering them and seeing them excel!",

This has been verified to have best-in-class thinking by leading experts in the Sustainability sector. \n\nOn a separate project, I have built a pilot social media sentiment corporate trust score for Accenture based on the Corporate Agility Index Arabesque provide.

Proposed to use an event driven architecture instead of monolithic, used Lambda functions with SQS and SNS features to message our internal SIGNALR hub and handling the message no the browser, the database was also designed by myself and implemented many stored procedures, functions eg. Our team consisted of DevOps and experienced Github + Teamcity + Octopus Deploy, created the project in Teamcity and used deployment templated in Octopus, with environment variables. The software is still in use by BMF and they were pleased with the outcome. I was also involved in internal Dealer Support System project, and delivered the internal app where regional managers used to send applications to head office by uploading documents, providing information, the tech stack were similar C#, MS SQL Server, AWS. Followed TDD approach and created unit tests with XUNIT but I am also capable to use NUNIT. Integrated authentication mechanism with OKTA.",

        "summary": "I am a computational linguist holding a PhD in Natural Language Processing. I have 9 years of research and industrial experience in NLP. I have worked on a wide set of tasks, ranging from tokenisation and stemming to entity and relation extraction, text classification and building knowledge graphs from texts. I have experience with rule-based, statistical and machine learning methods in NLP. I have extensive experience with text annotation, preparing annotation guidelines, and annotation quality assurance.\n\nOne of my main professional passions is AI for Good and, in particular, applying NLP in the healthcare domain. I worked in biomedical NLP for several years and completed a PhD project devoted to detecting “spin” (unjustified positive presentation of clinical trial results) in biomedical articles. My PhD thesis can be found at https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=f25c8dc7-3bf3-4fb9-be2d-c456681b4291, and the original source code at https://github.com/aakorolyova/DeSpin. I am currently working on a new and improved version of the code that can be found here: https://github.com/aakorolyova/DeSpin-2.0. Besides, I’m an active member of Omdena AI for Good community (https://omdena.com), having participated in 3 challenges as a Machine Learning Engineer and in 1 challenge as the Product Owner.\n\nAnother area that has recently sparked my interest is Conversation Design. I participated in two AI challenges devoted to developing chatbots (read a blog about it at https://omdena.com/blog/how-to-build-a-chatbot-using-rasa/). \n\nYet another passion of mine is multi-lingual NLP. Apart from English, I speak Russian (my mother tongue), French, Italian (have not practiced for a while but used to have level B1), currently learning German. I had introductory half-a-year courses of Hungarian, Estonian and Esperanto. It just feels to me that limiting the scope of work to English is so... well, limiting! In one of my previous jobs, I used to manage a team of linguists developing NLP tools for English, Russian, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic - that was challenging but so much fun!\n\nI am proficient in Python and have good knowledge of machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. I am experienced in NLP libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, stanza, Huggihgface's transformers.\n\nMy GitHub profile: https://github.com/aakorolyova",

I work closely with research scientists and pair with them on algorithms, research direction, and experiment design.\n- I support research projects with software design expertise, striking the balance between maintainable research code and fast iterative results-oriented experimentation, and advise scientists on the best way to implement theoretical algorithms. I maintain tools and libraries for efficient multi-node training on our computing cluster and support their adoption in other teams.\n- We read papers every week, incorporating new ideas into our current algorithms or implementing new algorithms from scratch. Once a year, I attend an ML conference and present best papers to the science staff (attended MIDL in 2022).\n- I've been a core contributor to our new internal ML libraries for model training and inference, architecting core components and seeing through their adoption by all AI teams. I have a good knowledge of PyTorch, distributed model training, and learned a lot about user experience of ML libraries for research.\n- I regularly give internal knowledge-sharing talks, and also continuously improving my own knowledge of deep learning and statistics, reading textbooks, attending university lectures, and staying up to date with the latest research.\n\nKeywords: computer vision, weakly-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, deep learning, transformers, convolutional neural networks, GPU computing, CUDA, PyTorch, Python.",

BIO Air Filtration, Water Treatment and Antiviral Masks; We require no external energy, UV, bipolar ionisation, heavy metals or toxic chemicals for our solution to function.\n\n1.1 A plant based Polymer for the creation of a world first Air Filtration technology, these are not your ordinary air filters. They have the unique ability to capture, inactivate and eradicate up to 99.99% of viruses, bacteria, molds, fungi, and pollens. This means that they not only trap but also destroy the harmful microorganisms and allergens that can affect your health and comfort.\n1.2 We have the ability to apply the polymer to any fabric and make it active against viruses, bacteria, molds, fungi, and pollens, this can be utilised in buildings without HVAC for example.\n1.3 We can apply the polymer to medical devices such as catheter tubes\n1.4 200+ innovations on our roadmap \n\n3. Packaging\n3.1 Our packaging solution is safe in any end of life scenario be that Oceans, Rivers, Landfill, throw on the floor and recyclable through existing paper waste streams.\n3.2 We have control of the raw material, to recipes and finished goods, all under one roof.\n3.3 We also offer compostable and Biodegradable resins, recipes and finished goods\n3.4 I will also look for niche brands to support the HEMP packaging industry with all the above benefits whilst supporting communities and giving supplier diversification from traditional Paper / plastic\n\nBy collaborating worldwide with the best minds and innovators to provide solution's that benefit Governments, Organisations, Manufacturers, people and Ultimately the Environment we live in.\n\nDisrupting trillion dollar industries wont be easy but the journeys end will have been worth it.\n\nThe solutions are out there, but are not joined up or their voices unheard, ask me a question to a problem and maybe I can point you to an answer without using AI :-)",

Over the past 4+ years, I've been fortunate enough to work in various roles that have allowed me to hone my skills in building and designing cutting-edge RESTful APIs and database design. Having served as a Scrum Master on a project for several months, I deeply value the Agile methodologies I implemented during that time. This experience enabled me to help ensure projects were delivered efficiently, on time, and to the highest quality standards.\n\nMy journey in tech started as a Junior Front-End Developer where I developed a strong foundation in React, Redux, HTML5, CSS3, and Svelte. From there, I gravitated towards backend development, diving headfirst into Nest.JS, Node.JS, TypeScript, TypeORM, and Sequelize. While my primary focus lies in TypeScript development, I've had the opportunity to gain some experience in Go, adding another layer to my skillset.\n\nIn addition to my core programming skill set, I've explored QA Automation using tools like Selenium, Cucumber, and Gherkin, leveraging Java in the process. This exploration was part of my endeavour to grasp the broader context of software development and diversify my understanding of various processes within the field.\n\nIf there's one thing that stands out about me, it's my passion for tech - a passion inspired by the story of Aaron Swartz [The Internet's Own Boy]. I continually strive to share knowledge, assist in the onboarding of new team members, and foster a learning and collaborative environment.\n\nI thrive when faced with new challenges that push me to flex my technical muscles and let my leadership qualities shine. I genuinely enjoy the thrill of making a real impact and contributing in ways that matter. Connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts and finding avenues to contribute creatively to new projects is something I truly look forward to.

These models are then reduced and implemented in embodied solutions like robots, electronic devices and software programs. In this way self-organization is achieved at different scales from the microscopic level (ion-channels, neural networks) to the macroscopic scales like swarm systems. Swarm systems self-organise themselves using local interactions and communication but what plays an important role is the processing of the information. \nSwarm systems can then applied to solve different tasks like automatic surveillance, personal care and assisted learning. \nA mix of networked sensors –bio, vision, and audio sensors- can be fused together with prosthesis to monitor a human subject and assist him in daily tasks including walking, pharmaceutical schedule assumptions or body regulation like insulin.\nThere’s a great potential in this approach that must be pursued for the sake of humanity.\n\nSpecialties: Artificial intelligence, embedded systems, network sensors, autonomous robots: UGV and UAV.",

As CTO, I integrated deep learning and networking into innovative solutions, growing a client base to about 100 within a year.\n\nRecently, I've been exploring how advancements in natural language processing, specifically generative models, can enhance and support modern education systems and government. If you are interested in discussing about this, please contact me.\n\nIn my free time, you can catch me training in the gym, enjoying nature, or tasting new dishes.",

Adam shares his thoughts and ideas through public speaking, tech community events, on his blog, and in his podcast.\n\nMany organisations aren't getting the most out of their data and many data professionals struggle to communicate their results or the complexity and value of their work in a way that business stakeholders can relate to. Being able to understand both the technology and how it translates to real benefits is key.\n\nSimply hiring the most capable people often isn’t enough. The solution is a mix of clear and explicit communication, strong fundamentals and engineering discipline, and an appetite to experiment and iterate to success quickly. \n\nIf this is something you’re struggling with - either as an organisation finding its feet with data and AI or as a data professional - the approaches and systems Adam has developed over his career will be able to help so please reach out.\n\nCutting-edge data technologies are redefining every industry and adopting these new ways of working can be difficult and frustrating. One day, there will be best practices and playbooks for how to maximise the value from your data and teams, but until then Adam is eager to share his experiences in both business and data and shed some light on what works.",

        "summary": "I come from a real-time embedded computer vision background and machine learning and AI, ( in particular AGI ) with 37 years track record. In 2015 I focused on AI based vision using deep neural nets and spent some time rebuilding the basics of the science and technology to understand the limitations and find alternative solutions. Since then I have moved on to develop a combined bottom-up visual perception with top-down cognitive context within an adaptive inference approach that is computationally efficient and sparse via task-based attention. Along the way I developed a working theory of mind and an entirely new neuro-connectionist approach to AGI which I am always happy to discuss.\n\nSome of my main interests are AGI, object-centric representations, 3D computer vision, cognitive architectures, and embedded computing and electronics. I code in C++ for efficient applications and Python for rapid prototyping using PyTorch nowadays . I have built tech teams and managed projects including cloud based AI deployment. However, I prefer to self-start and just manage my own technical work and direction. I am a creative innovator bringing a multi-disciplinary approach to problem solving combining math, physics, computer science, computer vision, AI, AGI, embedded computing, and even microelectronics to solve problems, create new concepts and products, and quickly discover the right path by assessing risks early. I have specified and developed many CV based innovative products over the last 3 decades since leaving academia and government research, and I am as comfortable in stakeholder facing situations as coding or other technical development.\n\nI typically develop using Visual Studio on Windows though I also am working on the nVidia Jetson embedded platform ( Orin ), coding in C++, user interfaces using C# and Windows Forms with some cloud micro-service development, and deep neural network development using Pytorch/Python. I have developed extensively on embedded platforms from bare metal upwards including bringing up peripherals, OS, and storage devices, and USB.\n\nOver the last decade I have had many projects in the automotive space relating to object detection, semantic segmentation, and 3D reconstruction. One particular area of interest is adaptive multi-scale neural networks for detect-and-track that greatly reduces the computational load. After all, why process pixels you don't need or irrelevant details at high res?",

        "titleDescription": "I founded DeepSee AI in 2016 as a subcontractor for the newly developing field of neural network based visual perception, and it has been a busy six years! Earlier in this role I was heavily into automotive prototypes including semantic segmentation, monocular 3D reconstruction, and novel approaches to object instance detection as well as improving the basic science for training of deep neural networks. Nowadays my passion is combined cognition and perception within a new neuro-connectionist approach that is based upon what I call quasi-symbolic reasoning that I believe is the future of AI+AGI as it is both efficient and general purpose.\n\nMainly I work with C++ and CUDA for performance applications and I have a big interest in nVidia Orin SOM. For deep nets research I code with Python + Pytorch or other deep learning framework and have 6 years of building my own code libraries. I prefer to develop UI in C# and call into C++/CLI middleware dotnet libs on top of platform independent C++ code/libs, as C# is great for UI and very fast compared to Python, and allows true concurrent threading.\n\nI prefer R&D into next gen science and technology, particularly visual perception and cognition, whether on desktop or embedded / IoT. I am equally at home with engineering efficient solutions. As an in-house project since 2018, I have been developing an alternative to backprop trained deep neural nets that combines visual perception and cognition seamlessly and is aimed at an agent learning through self-direction much like a human, and generalizing much like a human. In principle, this allows the agent to bring its skills into a new task such as driving a vehicle, and I believe this is the only way that autonomous driving will be safe. As a side-effect, the cognitive agent is ( in principle ) able to describe what it is doing and how it reached its decisions via natural language. Another benefit is the capability to recruit external knowledge and skills just like a human.",
